# Doxchain

Doxchain is a decentralized identity provider (DIDP) built on Cosmos SDK. It aims to provide a secure and transparent way to control all your identity and access management needs while ensuring data integrity and privacy.

## Features

- **Decentralized:** Doxchain leverages the power of blockchain technology to create a decentralized network where identities are stored and managed across multiple nodes, ensuring reliability and resilience.

- **Identity Security:** Identities stored on Doxchain are encrypted and protected using advanced cryptographic algorithms, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

- **Immutable Records:** Once an identity is added to Doxchain, it becomes an immutable record that cannot be altered or tampered with by anyone other then its creator. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of the identity.

- **Access Control:** Doxchain provides a flexible access control mechanism that allows identity owners to define fine-grained permissions for different users, ensuring that only authorized individuals can interface with their personal DIDPs.

- **Auditability:** The transparent nature of blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a verifiable audit trail for compliance and regulatory purposes.
